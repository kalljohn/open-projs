*****  Overview  *****

This package includes samples that target Intel(R) Architecture processors,
coprocessors and Intel Processor Graphics.
The samples are supported only on Microsoft Windows* operating systems.

Refer to the sample User's Guide in the sample-specific directory for details
about each sample.

For complete list of supported operating systems and hardware, refer to the
release notes.


*****  Software Requirements  *****

The following software is required to correctly build and run samples:
  - Intel OpenCL implementation for target hardware set
  - Microsoft Visual Studio* 2008, 2010, or 2012

Visit the SDK website at http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/opencl
to get the relevant SDK version.

*****  Sample Directory Content  *****

Sample files reside in the dedicated sample directories and in the 'common'
directory in the root-level (where samples are extracted) directory.

The sample directory contains the following:

  - common                 -- directory with common utilities and helpers;
                              this functionality is used as a basic
                              infrastructure in the sample code

  - CapsBasic              -- Basic Device Capabilities Sample
  - GEMM                   -- General Matrix Multiply Sample
  - GodRays                -- Sample for High Dynamic Range Rendering with
                              God Rays Effect
  - MedianFilter           -- Median Filter Sample
  - MonteCarlo             -- Monte Carlo Method for Stock Options Pricing

  - OpenCLSamples_2008.sln -- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 solution file
  - OpenCLSamples_2010.sln -- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 solution file
  - OpenCLSamples_2012.sln -- Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 solution file
  - templates              -- project Property files
  - README.TXT             -- readme file

*****  Building Samples *****

The sample package contains the Microsoft Visual Studio solution files for
Visual Studio IDE version 2008, 2010, and 2012.

To build a certain sample,

  1. Open a relevant solution file from a designated sample directory.
  2. In Microsoft Visual Studio select Build > Build Solution.

You can build all samples from the package using the relevant solution file
from the sample root-level directory.


***** Running Samples *****

You can run a sample application using the standard interface of the
Microsoft Visual Studio, or using the command line.

To run the sample using the Visual Studio IDE, do the following:

1. Open and build the relevant solution file.
2. Select a project file in the Solution Explorer.
3. Right-click the project and select Set as StartUp Project.
Press Ctrl+F5 to run the application.
To run the application in debug mode, press F5.

To run the sample using command line, do the following:

1. Open the command prompt.
2. Switch to the directory, where resides the solution file you used.
3. Then go to the directory according to the platform configuration:
    - \Win32 - for Win32 configuration
    - \x64 - for x64 configuration;
4. Open the appropriate project configuration (Debug or Release).
5. Run the sample by entering the name of the executable.
6. You can run samples with command-line option -h or --help to print all
   available command line options for the sample.
